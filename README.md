## Overview
LoraCAT aims to provide a resilient, peer-to-peer communication solution in areas where traditional connectivity is limited. Leveraging LoRa technology and the Meshtastic framework, LoraCAT offers an effective means of establishing a decentralized network for basic communication needs. This project is a work in progress with defined objectives and ongoing development.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of the LoraCAT project are:
- **Develop a Decentralized Communication Network:** Create a peer-to-peer network that functions independently of centralized infrastructure.
- **Integrate Hardware & Software Solutions:** Design custom hardware (LoRa modules, microcontrollers, antennas, etc.) and tailor software based on Meshtastic to work seamlessly together.
- **Ensure Long-Range, Low-Power Communication:** Utilize LoRa technology to achieve reliable, low-energy communication over long distances.
- **Implement Secure Protocols:** Develop and integrate secure protocols to protect data and ensure reliable node-to-node communication.
- **Enhance Usability:** Provide easy-to-use configuration tools and diagnostic features to allow end users to set up and monitor the network effectively.
- **Community Collaboration:** Encourage open-source contributions and community-driven improvements to further the capabilities of the network.

## Features
- **Decentralized Communication:** Operates on a peer-to-peer basis without reliance on centralized servers.
- **Long-Range Connectivity:** Utilizes LoRa modules for extended range communication.
- **Integrated Hardware & Software:** Combines custom hardware design with optimized software for seamless performance.
- **Meshtastic-Based Framework:** Built upon the reliable Meshtastic network framework.
- **Open Source:** Promotes community collaboration and customization.

## Hardware
The LoraCAT hardware design is optimized for LoRa communication and includes:
- **LoRa Module:** (e.g., Semtech SX1276 or similar) for long-range data transmission.
- **Microcontroller:** (e.g., ESP32, Arduino, or other compatible boards) to control network operations.
- **Antenna:** High-performance antenna for extended communication range.
- **Power Supply:** Options for battery or external power ensuring energy efficiency.
- **Custom PCB:** Tailored design for seamless integration of all hardware components.

*Detailed schematics, a bill of materials (BOM), and assembly instructions are available in the `/hardware` directory.*

## Software
The LoraCAT software is based on the Meshtastic firmware with custom modifications to meet our specific network requirements:
- **Custom Firmware:** An optimized version of the Meshtastic firmware specifically designed for LoraCAT hardware.
- **Configuration Tools:** Simple command-line and/or mobile interfaces to configure network parameters.
- **Secure Communication Protocol:** Implements secure and efficient node-to-node data exchange.
- **Diagnostics and Monitoring:** Provides tools to monitor network health and performance.

*Source code, build instructions, and additional documentation are located in the `/software` directory.*
